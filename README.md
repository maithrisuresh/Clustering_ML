Introduction to clustering using python

Clustering is an example for unsupervised learning .
Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. It is basically a collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between them.
Clustering is very much important as it determines the intrinsic grouping among the unlabeled data present.

Applications of Clustering in different fields

Marketing : It can be used to characterize & discover customer segments for marketing purposes.

Biology : It can be used for classification among different species of plants and animals.

Libraries : It is used in clustering different books on the basis of topics and information.

Insurance : It is used to acknowledge the customers, their policies and identifying the frauds.

K-Means clustering algorithm is defined as a unsupervised learning methods having an iterative process in which the dataset are grouped into k number of predefined non-overlapping clusters or subgroups making the inner points of the cluster as similar as possible while trying to keep the clusters at distinct space it allocates the data points to a cluster so that the sum of the squared distance between the clusters centroid and the data point is at a minimum, at this position the centroid of the cluster is the arithmetic mean of the data points that are in the clusters.
This algorithm is an iterative algorithm that partitions the dataset according to their features into K number of predefined non- overlapping distinct clusters or subgroups. It makes the data points of inter clusters as similar as possible and also tries to keep the clusters as far as possible. It allocates the data points to a cluster if the sum of the squared distance between the cluster’s centroid and the data points is at a minimum where the cluster’s centroid is the arithmetic mean of the data points that are in the cluster. A less variation in the cluster results in similar or homogeneous data points within the cluster.


Here I have used python to perform K means Clustering on the country data set available in https://www.kaggle.com/rohan0301/unsupervised-learning-on-country-data/data
